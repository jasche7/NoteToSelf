## Reflection

This project was imagined as a tool for me to easily copy and paste text between devices in a persistent yet secure manner. Email drafts provide a similar function but end up cluttering, which is not ideal.

I prioritized learning good development practices, such as unit testing, clean code, and documentation. There is also the goal of familiarizing with practical aspects of web development, such as database management and security.
